This is a type generic dense matrix library that is compatible with the C11 standard.
The compile time generics are achieved through minimal inclusion of C preprocessor
directives and the new C11 _Generic keyword for "overloaded" functions.

This is a work in progress and is updated as my needs require. There will be soon
a type generic interface to BLAS and LAPACK routines.
